## Overview

The estimated time to complete this lab is 30 minutes.
In this lab, you will explore Report Builder, and learn how to add and configure various report objects.
To accelerate the development of reports, and to promote consistency of report design, you will also develop a report template. The template will be the starting design for new reports developed in other labs of this course.

## Exercise 1: Develop a report template

In this exercise, you will create a portrait report template.

### Task 1: Create the report

In this task, you will create a report template.

1. Open a new instance of Power BI Report Builder.
2. In the Getting Started pane, select **Blank Report**.
3. To save the report, on the File ribbon tab, select **Save As**.

   * Tip: You can also press Ctrl+S, or click the disk icon at the top-left of the Report Builder window.
4. In the Save As Report window, at the left, select **My Computer**.
5. Navigate to the `<CourseFolder>\PowerBIPRIAD\MySolution` folder.
6. In the Name box, replace the text with **Portrait Template**.
7. Click **Save**.
8. At the top of the Report Builder window, notice that the file name is displayed.

*Report Builder can only have one file open at a time. However, it’s possible to open multiple instances of the Report Builder application—each with one report open.*

### Task 2: Explore Report Builder

In this task, you will explore Report Builder.

1. Notice the ribbon, consisting of **File, Home, Insert, and View** tabs.

   * The *Home* ribbon supports toggling between design mode and preview mode. It also provides functionality to manage the clipboard and formatting.
   * The *Insert* ribbon provides commands to add data regions, visualisations, report items, and to enable/disable headers and footers.
   * The *View* ribbon lets you determine which panes and features to show or hide.

2. On the View ribbon tab, check all checkboxes to show all panes and the ruler:

   * Report Data
   * Properties
   * Grouping
   * Ruler
   * Parameters

   For this course, it’s suggested you leave them all enabled.

3. In the centre, notice the **report designer**, with the ruler on the left and top.

4. On the left, notice the **Report Data** pane (manages resources defined within the report).

5. On the right, notice the **Properties** pane (shows properties for the selected object).

   * Properties can also be configured on the Home ribbon.
   * By default, properties are grouped by category but can be listed alphabetically.

6. At the top, beneath the ribbon, notice the **Parameters** pane.

7. At the bottom, notice the **Grouping** pane.

8. At the bottom-right, notice the **zoom control** and the design/preview toggle.

### Task 3: Design the report layout

In this task, you will design the report template layout.

* The default blank report consists of a **body** and **footer**, containing two text boxes:

  * Report title
  * Execution time

Steps:

1. Click beneath the *Click to add title* text box.

2. In Properties, notice the **Body** object is selected.

3. Click left of the `[&ExecutionTime]` text box (footer is selected).

4. Modify the design to become your template.

5. Click a grey area outside the layout (selects Report).

6. Right-click grey area > **Report Properties**.

7. Ensure **Page Units** = Inches.

8. **Paper Size** = Letter.

9. Margins = **0.5in** each.

10. Report body width = **7.5 in** (8.5 – margins).

11. In Properties > Size:

    * Width = 7.5
    * Height = 2

12. Add a **page header** (right-click grey area > Add Page Header).

13. Set header height = 1 in.

14. Set footer height = 0.5 in.

15. Move the title text box into the header (top-left).

16. Set Width = 6.5, Font size = 20pt, Font weight = Bold, Border bottom = Solid.

17. Right-click > Expression. Insert `=Globals!ReportName`.

18. Insert a second text box in the header (beneath title).

* Name = ReportSubtitle
* Location top = 0.5, width = 6.5, height = 0.3

19. Insert an **image** (right side of header).

* Name = CompanyLogo
* Import `AdventureWorksLogo.jpg`
* Size: 0.8 x 0.8, Location left = 6.7

20. Modify footer text box. Default shows `[&ExecutionTime]`.

* Replace with:

```vbnet
="Generated at " & Format(Globals!ExecutionTime, "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss") & " UTC" & vbCrLf & 
"Page " & Globals!PageNumber & " of " & Globals!TotalPages
```

### Task 4: Finalise the design

1. Verify object sizes:

   * Header height = 1
   * Body width = 7.5
   * Body height = 2
   * Footer height = 0.5

2. Preview report (Home > Run).

   * Report title may not display.
   * Execution time shows local time (machine).

3. Use **Print Layout** to preview page size.

4. Export as **PDF**.

5. Save to `<CourseFolder>\PowerBIPRIAD\MySolution`.

6. Verify PDF is one page.

7. Delete PDF.

8. Return to design mode.

9. Save the report.

10. Close Report Builder.

*Your report template is now complete. It will be reused in other labs.*
